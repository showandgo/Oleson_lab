""" This file provides a step by step guide to developing the road network dataset for MHI recreation model """

You will be working with two spatial datasets- the 1. DOT, and 2. State GIS Portal.
Only the DOT dataset will have speed limits. 

# Get avg speeds for roads in DOT notebook
First, compile average speeds in the DOT dataset by pulling out roads with speed limit entries, 
then calculate average speeds by assuming travel at speed limit over the combined length of the road.
Aim is to come up with unique road names that have their corresponding average speeds (filename "dot_spd_comb.csv"). 
NOTE that longer roads will have duplicates while shorter ones won't

# Join DOT to state data
Next we will match speeds in the DOT data to the roads in the state GIS data
Read in state GIS portal dataset (filename "hnl_roads.xls")
The road names will be the unique identifier that will create the join between the two datasets.
DOT dataset spells road names in full while the state GIS data does not, so we need to manipulate the state GIS 
data so that speeds from DOT will map onto the state GIS data.
NOTE that the state GIS data has the more extensive road network so it will be the eventual final product
Version 2 just manually adds
